      <description>Problem Statement: On 15th August 2024, an incident occurred where the CPUBusyPercent alert did not trigger for one of our Production MySQL Database VMs (DB01), despite the CPU being at 100% for seven minutes. This was unexpected since the threshold settings in LogicMonitor were supposed to trigger alerts under such conditions.
Figure 1: CPU usage plateau at 100% for 6 minutes without triggering an alert.
Analysis: The initial investigation revealed that the CPUBusyPercent alert settings were configured to trigger an alert after five consecutive polls (which equates to 6 minutes of sustained high CPU usage).</description>
