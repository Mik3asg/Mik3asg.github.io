      <description>Problem Statement On Friday 6th September 2024 at 21:31, we received an alert from LogicMonitor indicating one of our production web app servers (Tomcat#3) was down, with the message: &amp;quot;The host Tomcat#3 (i-xxxxxxx) is down&amp;quot;. However, shortly after receiving the alert, we attempted to SSH into the VM and confirmed that the server was fully operational.
Root Cause Investigation and Resolution A ticket was promptly raised with our IT service provider, responsible for managing our Cloud Production workloads, immediately following the alert.</description>
