      <description>Problem Statement On Friday, September 6th at 21:31, we received an alert from LogicMonitor, our cloud monitoring service, indicating that one of our production web app servers (Tomcat#3) was down. Receiving such an alert late on a Friday is never ideal. After SSH-ing into the server, I confirmed it was still operational, pointing to an issue with the monitoring system rather than the VM.
Analysis A ticket was raised with our IT service provider, who manages our cloud workloads and VMs.</description>
